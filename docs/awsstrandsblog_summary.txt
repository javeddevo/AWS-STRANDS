The article announces the release of "Strands Agents," an open-source SDK by AWS for building and running AI agents. Strands simplifies agent development by leveraging advanced model capabilities for planning, chaining thoughts, calling tools, and reflection, reducing the need for complex workflows. It connects models and tools, allowing developers to define an agent with a prompt and a list of tools. Strands supports various models, including those in Amazon Bedrock, Anthropic, Ollama, and Meta, and offers flexible tool integration. It enables customization of agent behavior, context management, and multi-agent applications. The article highlights that Strands significantly reduces development time for production-ready agents, from months to days or weeks, compared to previous frameworks. It also discusses core concepts of Strands Agents, including models, tools, and prompts, and how the agentic loop facilitates dynamic task completion. The article provides examples of pre-built tools for semantic search, deep analytical thinking, and multi-agent orchestration. Finally, it details how to get started with Strands Agents, including code examples for building a naming AI assistant, and discusses deployment options for production environments, emphasizing observability through OpenTelemetry.
